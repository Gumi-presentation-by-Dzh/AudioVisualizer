Hello!

This is a demo to use HTML5 Audio Context API.

Now there are only very simple visualizer effects, but I will add some interesting effect in future.

You can see the the demo on the project page: http://qieguo2016.github.io/AudioVisualizer/

This demo is base on wayou Liu's article. You can see his page: http://wayou.github.io/MeowmeowPlayer/
