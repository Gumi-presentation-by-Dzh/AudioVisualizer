Hello!

This is a demo to use HTML5 Audio Context API.

Now there are only two kinds very simple visualizer effects, but I will add some interesting effect in future.

You can see the the demo on the project page: http://qieguo2016.github.io/AudioVisualizer/

  If you visit this demo on PC, Move Your Mouse to capture the balls!
  
  If you visit this demo on mobile device, touch the ball and move them!

This demo is base on wayou Liu's article. You can see his page: http://wayou.github.io/MeowmeowPlayer/
